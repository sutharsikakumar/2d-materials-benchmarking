Redraw using origin lab and add masks manually

Different benchmarking methods, 
Raman spectra 

MoS2 bilayer, orientation, 2H face, 1T face, different Raman for all of them, chart 

Input Raman that whether correct material correct guess on layer number, face, cross or check for correct or not

OriginLab 

Building a prompt that builds a framework, test this framework, choose materials… change from figure to chart 

Graphene layer number, stacking order,
